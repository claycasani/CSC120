1. Problem Description
----------------------
The problem is to manage a fleet of boats. The program should be able to load boat data from a CSV file or a database file, allow the user to add, remove, and update boat information, and save the updated data back to the database file. The program should also provide a report of the fleet, including the total amount paid and spent on the boats.

2. Information Provided
------------------------
- Input Data:
  - CSV file containing boat details (type, name, year, make/model, length, purchase price)
  - Database file containing serialized boat objects
  - User input for adding, removing, and updating boat information

- Input Data Format:
  - CSV file: Each line contains comma-separated values representing a boat's details
  - Database file: Serialized ArrayList of Boat objects
  - User input: Text input via the console

- Expected Results:
  - Output Data:
    - Fleet report displaying each boat's details and the total amount paid and spent
    - Confirmation messages for adding, removing, and updating boat information
    - Error messages for invalid input or operations

- Output Data Format:
  - Console output for fleet report and messages

3. Handling Data Entry Errors
------------------------------
- Validate CSV file format and content
- Validate user input for adding, removing, and updating boat information
- Display error messages for invalid input or operations

4. Assumptions
---------------
- The CSV file contains valid data with the correct number of fields
- The database file is accessible and contains valid serialized data
- User input is provided in the expected format

5. Structuring/Recording Solution Information
----------------------------------------------
- Information to be recorded:
  - Boat details (type, name, year, make/model, length, purchase price, expenses)
  - Fleet data (ArrayList of Boat objects)

- Quantity of Information:
  - Variable number of boats in the fleet

6. User Interaction
--------------------
- User interface: Console-based interaction
- User actions:
  - Load fleet data from a CSV file or database file
  - Add a new boat to the fleet
  - Remove a boat from the fleet
  - Add an expense to a boat
  - Print the fleet report
  - Save the fleet data to the database file
  - Exit the program
