1. Initialize Program
   1.1 Print a welcome message for the Floridian Tooth Records.
   1.2 Set constants for maximum number of family members, teeth per member, and valid tooth types (I, B, M).
   1.3 Create arrays to store family member names and their teeth records.

2. Get Data
   2.1 Get Family Size
      • Prompt the user for the number of people in the family.
      • Validate input to ensure it falls within the maximum limit.
   2.2 Collect Family Member Data
      • For each family member:
         • Prompt for and store the member's name.
         • Prompt for and store the upper and lower teeth data for the member, ensuring validity.

3. Display Menu and Process User Selection
   3.1 Display options for (P)rint, (E)xtract, (R)oot, or e(X)it.
   3.2 Execute the corresponding function based on the user's selection:
      • Print Records (P): Call the printRecords method to display all family members' dental records.
      • Extract Tooth (E): Call extractTooth method to mark a specified tooth as missing.
      • Report Root Canal Indices (R): Call reportRootCanalIndices to compute and display root canal information.
      • Exit (X): Print an exit message and terminate the program.

4. Functionality Details
   4.1 Get Valid Family Size
      • Continuously prompt for a family size until a valid integer within range is provided.
   4.2 Get Valid Name
      • Prompt for and return a family member's name.
   4.3 Get Valid Teeth Data
      • For each family member, prompt for upper and lower teeth data (must be within valid teeth types and length).
   4.4 Check Validity of Teeth Data
      • Verify that all characters in the input are within the allowed teeth types (I, B, M).

5. Print Records
   5.1 Loop through each family member and display:
      • The member's name.
      • Upper and lower teeth layers with their respective tooth positions and types.

6. Extract Tooth
   6.1 Prompt for the family member's name and validate the input.
   6.2 Prompt for the tooth layer (Upper or Lower) and validate.
   6.3 Prompt for the tooth number and verify:
      • That the tooth is not already missing (M).
      • If valid, mark the tooth as missing by setting it to M.

7. Report Root Canal Indices
   7.1 Calculate the frequency of each tooth type (I, B, M) across all family members.
   7.2 Compute the discriminant for the root canal index.
      • If negative, indicate no real roots.
      • If positive, calculate two potential root canal indices and display them.
