1. Get data
    1.1  Prompt for length of the side of the square of land (in km)
    1.2  Prompt for the length of roads running through the square (in km)
    1.3  Prompt for the number of kangaroos living in that square

2. Perform computations
    2.1  Area is the length of the side of the square of land squared
    2.2  Kangaroo density is number of kangaroos divided by area
    2.3  Surface area is road length multiplied by the average road width
    2.4  Number of deaths as a decimal is surface area multiplied by the kangaroo density and the roadkill constant
    2.5  The number of expected deaths is the number of deaths decimal as an integer
    2.6  The number of expected injuries is the 1 if the death decimal subtracted by the number of expected deaths si greater than 0

3. Display the number of expected deaths and expected injuries
